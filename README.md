# WAP Tests

## Introduction

This repository contains UI tests for WAP Testing.

## Project Structure

The system uses a page object model style format to store elements and interactions within each page. All actions should be defined within pages and not be written within the tests folder to keep the tests maintainable and readable.

The actions in each page use the robot pattern that allows test cases to join operation via the (.) operator.
Each method inside the page should default to returning self in order to maintain this pattern.

Pytest is the test runner for this framework. Whenever possible, create a pytest fixture to set up test appropriate and not to bloat test cases.

## Directory and File Descriptions

### `config/Data.py`
Contains configuration files for the tests. Incudes Data.py which holds constants and data used in the test cases.

### `pages/common.py` and `pages/twitch_page.py`
Folllows Page Object Model pattern. There is a `common.py` that contains all basic and common methods shared accross different pages. The specific pages like `twitch_page.py` is tailored to include xpaths and methods specific to a page being tested.

### `screenshots/`
Contains all test artifacts such as screenshots and recordings of test runs.

### `tests/`
This is where the test files reside with test cases specific to a feature. It is also recommended to group test scripts within tests folder on a feature level and implement test suites. The scripts here utilizes and calls page objects, configurations and data that are contained in the other directories.

### `.env`
Stores environment-specific variables required by `Data.py`. This file should be kept local and is listed in `.gitignore` to avoid exposing sensitive data.

### `.gitignore`
Specifies files and directories that should be excluded by Git.

### `requirements.txt`
Lists the Python packages and their versions required to run the tests, ensuring that dependencies are managed consistently.

## To run a test, do the following:

1. Create a `.env` file with all required variabled from `.config/data.py`
2. Install all libraries from requirements.txt
> pip install -r requirements.txt
3. To run a test:
> pytest tests/{filename}.py
